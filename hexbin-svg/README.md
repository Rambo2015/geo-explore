Shows how to draw a US map using a topojson file from the [us-atlas](https://github.com/topojson/us-atlas) project, while drawing a number of points across the map in SVG. It uses semantic zooming to make it easier to select individual points after zooming in. Makes use of [d3-tip](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip) for simple tooltips when hovering on points.
